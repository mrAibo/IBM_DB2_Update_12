# Script for DB2 Upgrade (e.g., 11.5 to 12.1) via Instance Recreation and Database Restore
# Original script concept provided by the user. Refactored for clarity and robustness.
# This script automates:
# 1. Backup of databases from the old instance.
# 2. Dropping the old instance.
# 3. Creating a new instance with the new DB2 version.
# 4. Restoring databases into the new instance.
# 5. Applying post-restore configurations.
# WARNING: This script is destructive as it drops the DB2 instance.
#          Ensure full, verified backups exist and you understand the process.
#          TEST THOROUGHLY IN A NON-PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
