# == DB2 FixPak Installation Placeholder Script ==

# This script is a placeholder to guide the FixPak installation process.
# The actual command and parameters can vary significantly based on the
# FixPak version, your environment, and whether it's an online or offline update.

# --- Prerequisites ---
# 1. Download the FixPak from IBM.
# 2. Extract the FixPak archive to a known location (e.g., /tmp/fixpak_files).
# 3. Ensure no active DB2 instances are using the installation path you are updating,
#    or follow IBM's instructions for online FixPak updates if applicable.
# 4. It's highly recommended to perform a full backup of your databases before applying a FixPak.

# --- Placeholder Command ---
# The typical command to install a FixPak is `installFixPack`.
# You will need to navigate to the directory where the FixPak files were extracted.
